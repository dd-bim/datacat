Unit name;Deutscher Name;Unit symbol;Dimension symbol;Quantity name;Definition
second;Sekunde;s;T;time;The duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.
metre;Meter;m;L;length;The distance travelled by light in vacuum in 1/299792458 second.
kilogram;Kilogramm;kg;M;mass;The kilogram is defined by setting the Planck constant h exactly to 6.62607015×10−34 J⋅s (J = kg⋅m2⋅s−2), given the definitions of the metre and the second.[10]
ampere;Ampere;A;I;electric current;The flow of 1/1.602176634×10−19 times the elementary charge e per second.
kelvin;Kelvin;K;Θ;thermodynamic temperature;The kelvin is defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1, (J = kg⋅m2⋅s−2), given the definition of the kilogram, the metre, and the second.
mole;Mol;mol;N;amount of substance;The amount of substance of exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities.[n 3] This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol−1.
candela;Candela;cd;J;luminous intensity;The luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 5.4×1014 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.
